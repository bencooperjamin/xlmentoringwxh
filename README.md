## User Experience - UX

### Strategy

 This project is inspired by a real charity that exists in Wrexham, Wales The aim of the website is to broaden the oportunities to recruit volunteers. The charity doesn't have a shortage of young people being referred but has a shortage of volunteer mentors. The Project Manager is mindful that parents, guardians, teachers and young people will have access to this sight. With this in mind it needs to be informative without it being academically out of reach for people who might struggle. Images to describe the journey and process were considered to be key.
 
#### User Stories

* __First Time Visitor Goals__

    a. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website and to learn more about the charity.

    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the site to access content without having to use the back button at any time.

    c. As a first time visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand the benefits of the charity to young people. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and how well known they are.

* __Returning Visitor Goals__

    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find infomation easily to show others.

    b. As a returning visitor, I want to know how to contact the business for more information.

* __Frequent User Goals__

    a. As a frequent user, I want to confidently recommend the charity to others.
    
    b. As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to check for new traing days and discover what current opportunities the charity has had.

### Scope

Taking all of the above into account I decided that we would need four main pages to begin with;

* __Home Page:__ This would provide users with charities motto along with some testimonials from young people who have benefited from the charity
* __About Us Page:__ This would provide crucial information covering who its for, who can volunteer,how it works and safeguarding
* __Gallery & Media Page:__ This would showcase some of the charities events, recognitions and links to magazines articles.
* __Contact Page:__ This would allow users to ask for more information and to show interest.

As well as the four main pages, links to the charities social media page, charity registration number and accreditations  would be clearly shown in the footer to direct users to other sites.

These four pages give the Project Manager a good starting idea about the potential for having their own website with room to expand the site to include more features in the future.

### Structure

The navigation route will be linear and will encourage users to go on a journey to learn about the work the charity does, the benefits to young people, read about the charity, view some of the events and past accolades and then opportunity to contact the charity for more information. This will be the order that the pages appear in the navigation bar.

The wireframes featured here are the initial design idea for the webpage. Some styling elements have been changed since testing to improve accessibility as per suggestions through lighthouse as well as positioning changes in the reviews section after viewing the live site.
